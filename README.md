Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS scaffold (App Router)

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Run development server

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- This scaffold uses the App Router and has no backend/API routes.
- Tailwind is configured in `tailwind.config.cjs` and globals are in `app/globals.css`.
